            PROCESS MANEGMENT(PART 2)
2-AUTOMATIC(batch) PROCESS :
    .process is not start by user 
        instead, the user schedule it for later start 
    .it is queued in a spooler area, to be excuted on a FIFO
    .it is scheduled in one of the following ways,
        1- schedule to run at a certain date and time 
            (using "at" command) 
        2- schedule to run when system load is low :D 
                ( using "batch" command )
        3- scheduled to run periodically with certain
             periodicity
    

    - [at command]
       . at [options] <time> <script-file>
    
        . at -f <scrit-file> <time>  # f = file  
            EX : 
            at 01.35 < job-to-run 
            at 9am February 2 <job-to-run 
            at tuesday +2 hours <job-to-run 
            at -f job-to-run noon -- noon = 12 pm
        OTHER COMMANDS : 
            $at -l  # list scheduled jobs 
            $ atq   # ...................
            $ at -r 3  # delete scheduled job #3
            $ atrm 3   # ....................... 
        


    - [batch command ]
        . batch < file containing jobs >
        EX : batch < file-to-run 


    - CRON JOBS 
         they are scheduled by the user to run at : 
            . fixed times 
            . fixed dates
            . intervals
         used often to automate repeated tasks
         they are called crontab 
        
        types of crontab files
            . user crontab files (per user file)
            . System crontab files (for root user)
            . other special files 

    -CRONTAB FILES FORMAT : 
        .one line per job 
        . each line has three section
            1- time scheduled section 
            2- user section 
            3- job Description section 

        EX * * * * * command to br excuted
           | | | | |_day of week(0-6)(Sunday -0)
           | | | |___month(1-12)
           | | |_____day of month(1-31)
           | |_______ hour(0-23)
           |________ minute (0-59)

        . EX 
            #execute backup.sh script every sunday at 2:50 AM
            50 2 * * 0 root backup.sh
            . THERE ARE OTHER SPECIAL STRINGS  :
                @reboot, @yearly, @annually, @monthly, @daily
                @midnight, @hourly 


        [crontab Command ] 
            - it checking for errors on the file 
                before saving  it 
            - crontab -e 
                . edite user crontab 
            - crontab -l 
                . display your crontab file 

            - crontab -r 
                . remove crontab file 


        SPEACIAL CRONTAB FILES : 
            - per user crontab 
            - system crontab file 
            - both of these categories of files are stored atq                  /var/spool/cron/crontabs
            - there are other crontab used be the system  :
               . the file  /etc/crontab[system]             
               . crontab files inside  /etc/con.d [packages]
            # NOT RECOMMENDED TO EDITE /ETC/CRONTAB OR 
                    /ETC/CON.D

        CRON JOBS OUTPUT : 
            -error messages for execution send to 
                /var/log/syslog
            -by default  using "email" command 
            - if you don't want to setup the email 
              redirect the output to /dev/null 
                ex : * * * * * rm * > /dev/null 





3-DAEMON PROCESSES : 
        - processes that run continously in background 
        - tradition is to have the daemon name ends with 
            letter "d" such ad (syslogd, xinetd, ftpd)
            d refer to daemon 
        
        - CREATION OF A DAEMON:
            1. the parent of daemon is killed 
            2. the daemon is detached from this controlling 
                terminal 
            3. becomes  a session leader (SID = PID)
            4. becomes a process group leader (PGID = PID)
            5. set its current directory to be the root dir
                (/) to allow other any file system to unmoun
            6. Close any relation that it inherited from its                parent process 
            7. sets its "stdin, stdout, stderr" to 
                - logfile , console, /dev/null 
           


        -MANAGING DAEMONS : 
            there is "init scripts" to  
                . check status 
                . start daemon 
                . stop daemon 
                . restart daemon 
            scripts are located in /etc/init.d
            EX : 
                sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth stop 
                .......................... start
                

                in other systems 
                $ sudo restart bluetooth
