                    PROCESS LIFE CYCLE 

PROCESS CREATION : 
    -Fork-exec procedure 
        this is done in two steps : 
            1- Fork:
                in this step new child (process) is created
                and prepare it with what it need to run 
                this includs: 
                    . Assign it a new pid
                    .creats associated structure in the kernel
                    .Sets the ppid, sid, and aother attributes
                    . add it to the kernel scheduler 
                    .copy parent's memory space to child
            2- Execute:
                child process separates from its parent 
                and move on with its functionality 
                this mean the child process will loaded with:
                    .new memory space instead of its parent 
                    .will lose access to parent process
                        resourses 

   

PROCESS VS THREAD : 
    - PROCESS : is new app like $vi 
    - THREAD : inside process there is more thread run; 
    From linux viewpoint : 
        both process and threads enable parallel operation
        (multi-tasking) with the help of scheduler in thread            kernel 
        -thread doesn't has address space , but it points to 
            parent address space 
            . all threads in the same process share address
              space to the parent process ; 
        - in linux a thread is a process with some special 
          differences:
        
PROCESS TERMINATION : 
     - process terminated by : 
        .Normal termination(reaching the end of its operation)
        .Receiving a Signal that cause it to terminate itself
        .terminated by the kernel
    - when the process is terminated, some of its resources
      are not yet released, and it changes its state to the 
        ZOMBIE state  ;

    - the process still zombie until the parent kill it 
        to cleanup ot resources 

PROCESS STATES : 
        RUNING:
            run during specific time slot 
        STOPPED: 
            stopped until resume signal come 
        WAITING FOR SOME EVENT:
           -doesn't take time slot 
           -waiting some event 
        ZOMBIE : 
            stopped and wait the parent to kill it to return
            resouces
