            Searching For Files


LINUX AND BINARY FILES : 
    
    $ls 
       - in this case the linux search for ls binary file 
         in PATH and execute it 
       
       - So can a user search for a binary file ?
        
SEARCH FOR BINARY FILE: 
    [ The which Command ] 
       - search for command , the same linux do , but doesn'
         run it ; 
       - if you able to run this file , you can know where 
            is it :D 
        
SIMPLE SEARCH : 
    [ Locate command ]
        -$locate <filename>
        -$locate <part of the path or filename>
            -locate command search on pre-prepared database 
             of all files in the system with their path 
        
        -the database used by locate is created by the prog. 
         "updatedb"
            . this prog. runs in CRON JOB that periodically
              updates the database 
            . new files may not be in DB for sometime 
            . to update DB manually 
                $ sudo updatedb 

        -locate command is useful for searching for
            system file or traditional linux file 
        
A SMARTER SEARCH : 
    [ find command  ]
        - search for file using different filters 
            name , size, last modification date, type, others
        -A combination of all of those search criteria 
        - Limit the search scope to certain directory 
        -skip some subdirectory from search scop 
        - allow to perform and action on all files that match
            
    Selecting the Search Scope 
            $ find ~ # list all files in home direcroty
            $ find ~ | wc -l 
        - you can put miltible passes 
            $find /bin /sbin /usr/bin 
            $ find ~/Documents | grep ".pdf"
    
    Adding Filters to the Search 
        
        Search by File type 
            $find <scope> -type <type>
            EX: $ find ~ -type d
                    # search for all directories 
                $find ~ -type l # symboliv links 
                $find ~ -type f
                $find ~ -type c  # character devices
                $find ~ -type b  # block device
